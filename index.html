		My interests include...[Psychology, music, and overall health. I cannot ever express enough my love for the human mind. It’s such a complex organic machine that’s still learning more about itself. Finally understanding why we all act the way we do is very fun and interesting for me to spend my time on. With music, I can literally listen all day every day because without it I can’t fully express how I feel. It’s one of the best parts of my day and I feel incomplete without it. Music is great for my health which is another important interest of mine. I try my best to become the best version of myself and that includes my overall health. I’m actively learning to eat healthier and activities to improve my physical and mental health. I really don’t want to age with different diseases and issues due to maltreatment to my own body.]
