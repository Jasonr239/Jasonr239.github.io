			About Me

	</h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
I'm a senior attending Bronx Early college Academy who's obtaining their IB certificate. I'm going to be graduating early in December due to my hard work, earning all the credits needed. Outside of school I spend time learning about different branches of psychology such as abnormal and developmental psychology. I find it really fun and interesting learning about the human mind. To think at one point we believed everyone was different for no reason! With such a passion I tend to help those that I care about with their issues. I teach great communication and how to be in touch with your emotions and learn the reasons behind that.

			Interests

	</h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		My interests include psychology, music, and overall health. I cannot ever express enough my love for the human mind. It’s such a complex organic machine that’s still learning more about itself. Finally understanding why we all act the way we do is very fun and interesting for me to spend my time on. With music, I can literally listen all day every day because without it I can’t fully express how I feel. It’s one of the best parts of my day and I feel incomplete without it. Music is great for my health which is another important interest of mine. I try my best to become the best version of myself and that includes my overall health. I’m actively learning to eat healthier and activities to improve my physical and mental health. I really don’t want to age with different diseases and issues due to maltreatment to my own body.
