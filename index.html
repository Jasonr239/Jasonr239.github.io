			About Me

	</h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
I'm a senior attending Bronx Early college Academy who's obtaining their IB certificate. I'm going to be graduating early in December due to my hard work, earning all the credits needed. Outside of school I spend time learning about different branches of psychology such as abnormal and developmental psychology. I find it really fun and interesting learning about the human mind. To think at one point we believed everyone was different for no reason! With such a passion I tend to help those that I care about with their issues. I teach great communication and how to be in touch with your emotions and learn the reasons behind that.

			Interests

	</h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		My interests include psychology, music, and overall health. I cannot ever express enough my love for the human mind. It’s such a complex organic machine that’s still learning more about itself. Finally understanding why we all act the way we do is very fun and interesting for me to spend my time on. With music, I can literally listen all day every day because without it I can’t fully express how I feel. It’s one of the best parts of my day and I feel incomplete without it. Music is great for my health which is another important interest of mine. I try my best to become the best version of myself and that includes my overall health. I’m actively learning to eat healthier and activities to improve my physical and mental health. I really don’t want to age with different diseases and issues due to maltreatment to my own body.

   		<td>[Piece 1: When making this project I pixelated the picture so I can individually color in the boxes to make the pixel art. The character I made was an owl and if it was in a game it would be on an adventure to save other animals from poachers. The owl is purple and it’s also on the run of the poachers since it has a rare royal purple color in its feathers. I first wanted to create a mink but I changed to an owl to make the game be both on ground and in the air.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 2: When creating this animal I wanted to combine animals that are large with a tail of a smaller animal. So off the top of my head, I chose 3 animals to create a new improved beautiful animal. Their abilities would be running fast with strong antlers to fight. I combined a moose, tiger, and fox together by using the brush tool to erase the parts I dont need and put the parts together.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: When changing the color of the face I used a paint bucket to cover the entire picture. I chose the celebrity, Brent Faiyes, because he was my favorite artist at the time I made it. Brent Faiyez is an R&B singer who also makes clothes as he is into fashion himself. I used the selfie I picked because it showed his face off well and it was just a good picture of him to use.]</td>
